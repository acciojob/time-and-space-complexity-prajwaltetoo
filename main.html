    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the measure of the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the amount of time it takes to execute as a function of the input size. It helps us understand how an algorithm's performance scales with larger inputs. In essence, time complexity tells us how efficient an algorithm is in terms of time consumption.

        <b>Space Complexity</b> is another crucial aspect of algorithm analysis. It refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses to execute, also as a function of the input size. The notation <b>O(n)</b> is often used to denote space complexity, where 'n' represents the size of the input data. Efficient management of space is essential in situations where memory resources are limited.
