<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
<p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science and algorithm analysis. It refers to the measurement of the computational resources required by an algorithm as a function of the input size. When we talk about time complexity, we are primarily concerned with how the execution time of an algorithm scales with larger inputs. In essence, it helps us understand how efficient an algorithm is in terms of its running time.</p>
<p><b>Space complexity</b> is a critical concept in computer science and algorithm analysis, measuring the amount of memory or storage space required by an algorithm or program as a function of the input size. When we say an algorithm has a O(n), it means that the space used by the algorithm grows linearly with the size of the input.</p>
